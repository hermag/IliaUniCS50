        Form in HTML allows you to create an element, where you will be able 
        to enter the text, make the drop down menu, etc.
        In order to create the form in HTML, you need to use the <form> </form>
        tags, and create an element (for example, text box) inside.
        We can also add some text to that form, in order to make it clear what kind of input
        the form is expecting you to enter. Therefore we are using the label tag, it is also
        a good practice to associate the label and the corresponding form, therefore we are adding
        id to the input element and refer to that id from the label element, see code below.
    -->
    <form>
        <label for="fname">First Name:</label> <!--The for and id helps to make the text box active when you click the label text.-->
        <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" placeholder="Write your name here"> <!--we can add more attributes to the input element, such as name and placeholder-->
        <!--The name attribute you can consider as a variable, it will hold the text that you will write in the text box. Later you will be able to manipulate with this text using the name attribute (or variable if you want)-->
        <!--The placeholder will fill the form with some text in the moment of it's loading-->
    </form>
</body>
