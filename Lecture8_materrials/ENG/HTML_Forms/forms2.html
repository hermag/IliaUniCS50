    <!--
        Form in HTML allows you to create an element, where you will be able 
        to enter the text, make the drop down menu, etc.
        In order to create the form in HTML, you need to use the <form> </form>
        tags, and create an element (for example, text box) inside.
        We can also add some text to that form, in order to make it clear what kind of input
        the form is expecting you to enter. Therefore we are using the label tag, see below.
    -->
    <form>
        <label>First Name:</label>
        <input type="text" >
    </form>
